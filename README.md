## Features

- **Automatic:** Activates only when the Elden Ring window is active.
- **Safe:** 100% safe for Easy Anti-Cheat. It uses a standard Windows function (`ClipCursor`) and does not interact with game files or memory.
- **Lightweight:** Consumes virtually no system resources.
- **Customizable:** Easily change settings like padding or the exit hotkey.

## Installation

### 1. Download the Script

Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/silenceremember/Elden-Ring-Cursor-Lock/releases/latest) page and download the `EldenRing_CursorLock.ahk` file from the latest release.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script requires **AutoHotkey v2.0+** to be installed. You can download it from the [official AutoHotkey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

### 2. Run the Script

Double-click the downloaded `.ahk` file to run it. An 'H' icon will appear in your system tray. The script will now work automatically when you play the game.

- **To exit the script at any time, press `F11`**.

## Customization

You can edit the `.ahk` file with any text editor to change the parameters in the `SETTINGS` section:

```ahk
;================================;
;           SETTINGS             ;
;================================;
TargetProcess    := "eldenring.exe"
CheckInterval_ms := 10   ; 10ms = 100 checks per second
LockPadding_px   := 30   ; Dead zone in pixels from each edge
```
- **`LockPadding_px`**: Adjust the size of the "dead zone" from the screen edges.
- **`F11::ExitApp()`**: Change `F11` to any other key to set a new exit hotkey.
